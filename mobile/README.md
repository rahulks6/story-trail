# KATKEE mobile — Phase 1 through Phase 12

Real, hand-written TypeScript source for the design system, navigation shell,
authentication, search/follow, camera capture + the Story editor, publishing
and viewing Stories, the full gesture set plus likes/comments/sharing, real
analytics-event emission feeding the backend's recommendation system, a real
Activity tab backed by the backend's notifications, a real DM inbox and
conversation thread (including sharing a Story into a conversation), real
Highlights — create/edit/view, picked from a real Archive of every Story
you've ever published — a real Report flow (Story, comment, and
account) feeding the backend's moderation queue, and now everything
needed to actually ship this to the App Store and Play Store — real
account deletion, an environment config that points at a real deployed
backend instead of `localhost`, a crash boundary, and a hook for real
crash reporting — wired to the actual backend API (`../backend`) — not
generated boilerplate. It has **not** been built or run in this session;
see the limitation below before trusting it further, and see "Phase 3
specifically" for why that phase carries more risk than 1-2 (Phases 4-10
inherit the same camera/gesture risk, plus their own new ones — see each
phase's own "specifically" section). A best-effort `tsc` pass (no real
library types installed — see below) ran clean against every file
touched through Phase 12 (Phase 11 — the backend's production hardening —
needed no mobile changes at all; see "Phase 11 specifically" below for
why), for what that's worth given its limits. See `../DEPLOYMENT.md` for
the actual build-and-submit runbook and `../STORE_LISTING.md` for what
both stores require in the listing itself.

## What exists here

- **Phase 13 (spec realignment):** a pass against the full 123-section
  KATKEE master spec found real daylight between it and what Phases 1-12
  had built, and closed the highest-impact gaps:
  - `src/screens/story/StoryFeed.tsx` — the gesture/engagement core
    extracted from `StoryViewerScreen.tsx` so **Home can be the Story feed
    itself** (spec sections 4-6: zero-tap, full-screen, auto-advancing —
    not a tray you tap into, which is what Phase 6 actually shipped).
    `HomeScreen.tsx` now renders it directly; `StoryViewerScreen.tsx` is a
    thin wrapper used when a specific creator's Stories are opened from
    somewhere with a real "back" (a profile, a notification, a DM share).
    Reaching either edge of Home's feed shows a "you're all caught up" end
    state instead of navigating away, since Home has nowhere to go back to.
  - A Story's view count is now visible to **any** viewer who can watch it
    (previously owner-only), while who's actually behind that number stays
    a strictly owner-only `GET /api/v1/stories/:id/viewers` door —
    `src/components/StoryInsightsSheet.tsx`, opened by tapping the count on
    your own Story. Backend: `stories.repository.ts`'s new `listViewers`,
    `stories.service.ts`'s relaxed `getViewCount` + new `getStoryViewers`,
    both covered by new tests in `test/stories.test.ts`.
  - `src/components/HighlightsRow.tsx` rebuilt as an exactly-3-per-row grid
    of rectangular/portrait cards — spec section 62 explicitly rules out
    the circular Instagram-style bubbles this rendered as before.
    `ProfileScreen.tsx`/`UserProfileScreen.tsx` are now `ScrollView`s so a
    multi-row grid can't overflow off-screen.
  - `src/screens/profile/ArchiveScreen.tsx` (new) — a dedicated, private,
    month-grouped, multi-select grid over every Story you've ever
    published (`GET /api/v1/stories/mine/archive`, previously only fed the
    Highlight-creation picker). Multi-select feeds straight into creating
    a Highlight (`HighlightEditorScreen.tsx` gained an `initialStoryIds`
    preselect param) or bulk-deleting. Reached from a new **Archive** link
    on your own `ProfileScreen.tsx`.
  - `src/screens/activity/ActivityScreen.tsx` now groups consecutive
    `like` notifications for the same Story into one row ("Rahul, Priya
    and 12 others liked your Story" — spec's own example), instead of one
    row per like. Every other notification type is unaffected.
  - `LoginScreen.tsx`'s wordmark now matches the real brand logo — mixed
    case ("Kat" off-white + "kee" amber), not all-caps solid amber — and
    its subtitle is the real tagline ("Story that connects."), not a
    placeholder. `src/theme/colors.ts`'s `background`/`textPrimary`/`accent`
    are now **pixel-exact**, decoded from the actual logo file with a
    ~100-line pure-Python PNG parser (stdlib `zlib` only — no PIL, no
    ImageMagick, neither installable here), not eyeballed — every other
    near-black token shifted by the same delta so the whole scale carries
    the logo's real navy tint consistently. See `../BRAND.md` for the
    full extraction, exact pixel percentages, and the complete token
    table this reads from.
  - `ConversationScreen.tsx` now has real per-message delivery states
    (spec: Sending/Sent/Delivered/Read/Failed), shown as a caption under
    the single most recent message you sent (same convention as iMessage/
    WhatsApp), not on every message. Sending/Failed are purely client-
    local — an outgoing message is optimistically echoed into the thread
    immediately, tappable to retry if the send fails. Sent/Delivered/Read
    come from the backend's new per-message `status`, computed from a real
    `last_delivered_at` watermark (bumped whenever a participant's client
    actually fetches messages — the honest "delivered" signal available
    with no push/WebSocket channel) alongside the existing `last_read_at`.
    See `backend/README.md`'s Phase 13 section for the full mechanism.
  - `src/components/DraggableGrid.tsx` (new) — long-press-and-drag
    reordering, hand-rolled with `PanResponder` (no drag library
    installed). Closes the last major spec gap from this pass: Highlights
    can now be reordered (`HighlightsRow.tsx`, backed by a new
    `POST /api/v1/highlights/reorder` + `highlights.position` column —
    see `backend/README.md`'s Phase 13 section), and so can a Highlight's
    own contents (`HighlightEditorScreen.tsx`'s new "selected, in order"
    strip, persisted through the existing `updateHighlight` storyIds
    order — no new endpoint needed there). See "Phase 13 specifically"
    below for a real tradeoff this technique has with a scrolling parent.
  - **Story Insights, the deeper piece** (completion %, following-vs-
    discovery split, profile-visit rate) — the last remaining gap from
    this pass. `StoryInsightsSheet.tsx` (renamed from `StoryViewersSheet.tsx`,
    which it supersedes) now shows real stats above the viewer list:
    `GET /api/v1/stories/:id/insights` (owner-only, same door as the
    viewer list). A new `src/screens/profile/SequenceInsightsScreen.tsx`,
    reached from a new **Insights** link on your own `ProfileScreen.tsx`,
    shows the same stats aggregated across every Story you currently have
    active ("per-sequence Insights", spec) via
    `GET /api/v1/stories/mine/sequence-insights`. Every number here is
    real, computed from events this backend already records — see
    `backend/README.md`'s Phase 13 section for exactly what each rate
    means and the one honestly-disclosed approximation it makes
    (following-vs-discovery reflects a viewer's *current* follow
    relationship, not necessarily what it was at view time — this schema
    has no historical snapshot of that).
  - **Every real gap identified in the original spec pass is now closed.**
    The one remaining item, `ArchiveScreen.tsx`'s missing full-screen
    viewer for an individual expired Story, is done: a new
    `src/screens/profile/ArchivedStoryViewerScreen.tsx` (view-only, no
    like/comment/next — same philosophy as `HighlightViewerScreen.tsx`)
    plays back any of your own Archive Stories regardless of expiry. No
    backend change was needed — an owner already bypasses the normal 24h
    check for their own content, both for the Story detail fetch and the
    media file itself (see `media.routes.ts`'s `requireAccessibleMedia`).
    `ArchiveScreen.tsx`'s grid now distinguishes a plain tap (opens the
    viewer) from a long-press, or a tap while already mid-selection
    (toggles selection) — the Photos-app convention, not a new gesture
    library.
- `src/theme/` — the Katkee design system tokens: near-black background,
  off-white text, one amber/yellow accent (`colors.accent`) used for the
  Story ring, primary CTA, Follow, Create, and unread badges. No
  Instagram-style pink/purple gradients anywhere.
- `src/navigation/` — the exact 6-item bottom nav (`HOME | SEARCH | + |
  ACTIVITY | DM | PROFILE`) with a custom tab bar (`BottomTabBar.tsx`) that
  renders Create as a raised amber circle, not a 7th equal tab. No Discover
  tab.
- `src/state/AuthContext.tsx` + `src/api/` — real signup/login/logout/token
  refresh wired to the backend's actual endpoints and response shapes
  (kept in lockstep with `backend/src/modules/auth/*` — see the comment at
  the top of `src/api/client.ts`), with token persistence via AsyncStorage
  and automatic refresh-on-expiry.
- `src/screens/` — Login, Signup, Search, and the tapped-through user
  profile (follow/unfollow, including the "Requested" state for private
  accounts) are real, functional, wired to the Phase 2 backend endpoints.
  Home, Create (camera + editor), Activity, and DM are now all real too
  (see below) — the Profile tab shows the real authenticated user fetched
  from `/api/v1/auth/me`.
- `src/navigation/SearchStack.tsx` — the Search tab is its own stack
  (`SearchHome` → `UserProfile`) so tapping a result actually opens that
  person's profile (spec section 30), rather than everything living flush
  in the tab bar.
- `src/screens/create/CameraScreen.tsx` — full-screen capture against
  `react-native-vision-camera`: tap for a photo, press-and-hold for video
  (with a timer badge and a 60s cap), flip, flash, timer delay, pinch to
  zoom, tap to focus, double-tap to flip, and gallery import via
  `react-native-image-picker`.
- `src/screens/create/StoryEditorScreen.tsx` + `src/components/
  DraggableTextOverlay.tsx` — movable/pinch-resizable/two-finger-rotatable
  text overlays (hand-rolled multitouch on React Native's core
  `PanResponder`, reading `nativeEvent.touches` directly — no gesture
  library needed for this part), drag-to-trash delete, discard-protection
  on close, and a filter strip. Uploads the finished photo/video to the
  real `POST /api/v1/media/photos|videos` endpoints from Phase 3's
  backend work.
- `src/models/storyDraft.ts` — the `StoryDraft`/`Overlay` shapes from spec
  section 26, so a real renderer (later) can consume exactly what the
  editor already produces.
- `src/screens/create/StoryEditorScreen.tsx` now actually **publishes**:
  a caption field and a Public/Followers audience picker, then "Share
  Story" uploads the media and calls the real `POST /api/v1/stories`
  from Phase 4's backend work, landing back on Home.
- `src/screens/story/StoryViewerScreen.tsx` — the full-screen Story viewer
  (spec section 4), now with the complete gesture set: tap right/left move
  within a creator's Stories (crossing to the next creator once you tap
  past their last Story, per spec), swipe up/down move between creators
  outright, hold pauses (a real `Animated.timing`-driven progress bar per
  segment), and double-tap ensures a like — never unlikes, and single-tap
  navigation is deliberately delayed behind the double-tap window so a
  double-tap is never misread as two single taps first. Each view is
  recorded through `POST /api/v1/stories/:id/view`, and the resulting
  count is shown live (visible to any authorized viewer, not just the
  owner) — who's actually behind that number is a separate, strictly
  owner-only door (`GET /api/v1/stories/:id/viewers`, surfaced as a tap
  target only on your own Story). The gesture set and engagement rail
  live in `src/screens/story/StoryFeed.tsx`, shared by two callers: this
  screen (reached from a Story ring on your own or another user's
  profile, a notification, or a DM share — each has a real "back" to
  return to) and Home itself.
- `src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx` — Home *is* the Story feed (spec
  sections 4-6): it fetches `GET /api/v1/stories/feed/home` (Phase 6's
  ranked endpoint — followed creators plus real discovery, not just the
  follow graph) and renders `StoryFeed` directly, full-screen and
  auto-advancing from the moment Home opens — zero taps needed, not a
  tray you tap into. Swiping/tapping past the last creator shows a
  "you're all caught up" end state instead of navigating away, since
  Home has nowhere to go back to.
- `RootNavigator.tsx` wraps the tab navigator in a root-level stack so
  `StoryViewer` is reachable from any tab (Profile, Search, Home) without
  each tab's own stack needing to know about it.
- `src/components/CommentsSheet.tsx` — a bottom-sheet Modal (no
  bottom-sheet library installed) with real pagination, posting, and
  delete (your own comment, or any comment if you own the Story — spec
  section 14's moderation allowance), wired to the Phase 5 backend.
- `src/components/ShareSheet.tsx` — native OS share via React Native's
  built-in `Share` API, plus "Copy link" gated to public Stories only (spec
  section 15: "Sharing must NEVER bypass Story privacy") — see "Phase 5
  specifically" for what the copied link actually is.
- `src/components/StoryMoreMenu.tsx` — View Insights (real view count) and
  Delete for your own Story; Not Interested (Phase 6 — actually excludes
  that creator from your `feed/home`, not just a UI acknowledgment),
  Mute, and Block for someone else's. "Report" is still left out — it
  needs a moderation queue that doesn't exist (Phase 11).
- The right-side action rail (Heart with live count, Comment with live
  count, Share, More) on the Story viewer is real, not decorative — spec
  section 5.
- `src/api/events.ts` + real emission throughout `StoryViewerScreen.tsx`:
  `creator_impression`/`creator_sequence_started` on arriving at a
  creator, `story_impression` per Story shown, `watch_duration` +
  `qualified_view` (≥2s, per spec section 13) computed from real elapsed
  time on leaving a Story, `story_complete` only on a natural
  progress-bar finish (vs. `story_next`/`story_previous` for a tap and
  `creator_swipe_next`/`creator_swipe_previous` for a swipe — genuinely
  distinguished, not the same event relabeled), `creator_sequence_
  continued`/`creator_sequence_completed`, `quick_creator_skip` (spec
  section 8's negative signal — leaving a creator within 1.5s of
  arriving), and `comment_open`. `profile_visit` needs no client
  emission at all — the backend records it server-side, more reliably
  than trusting the client (see `backend/README.md`).
- `src/screens/activity/ActivityScreen.tsx` — a real notification list
  (spec section 31) fetched from the Phase 7 backend, grouped into
  Today/Earlier sections, with a Katkee-amber unread dot per row, pull to
  refresh, and pagination (`onEndReached` loads the next page). Tapping a
  like/comment notification opens that Story directly in the viewer (the
  recipient of those two types is always the Story's owner, so the
  viewer's own username is the correct `creators` entry — no extra lookup
  needed); tapping a follow, follow_request, or mention notification opens
  the actor's profile instead — see "Phase 7 specifically" for why mention
  doesn't always open the Story itself. "Mark all read" appears whenever
  the loaded page has an unread row.
- `src/state/NotificationsContext.tsx` — shares the unread count between
  `ActivityScreen` and a new amber badge on the Activity tab icon in
  `BottomTabBar.tsx`, polling `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count`
  every 20s while signed in (there's no push/websocket channel available
  in this sandbox — see `backend/README.md`).
- `src/navigation/types.ts` — `MainTabParamList`'s `Search` entry is now
  typed with `NavigatorScreenParams<SearchStackParamList>` so a sibling tab
  (Activity) can deep-link into Search's nested `UserProfile` screen via
  `navigation.navigate("Search", { screen: "UserProfile", params: {...} })`
  — the standard React Navigation pattern for reaching a screen nested
  inside a different tab than the one you're navigating from.
- `src/navigation/DMStack.tsx` — the DM tab is now its own stack
  (`DMInbox` → `Conversation` / `SendStory`), the same pattern as
  `SearchStack.tsx`.
- `src/screens/dm/DMInboxScreen.tsx` — a real conversation list fetched
  from the Phase 8 backend: other participant, a last-message preview
  ("You: " prefix for your own, "Shared a Story" for a story-only
  message), and an unread dot, pull-to-refresh, tap to open the thread.
- `src/screens/dm/ConversationScreen.tsx` — a real message thread: an
  `inverted` `FlatList` kept in the backend's own newest-first order (so
  "load older" is just `onEndReached` on the same list, no reversing),
  a composer that actually posts via `POST
  /api/v1/conversations/:id/messages`, mark-read on focus, and a 4s poll
  for new messages while the screen is open (see "Phase 8 specifically").
  A shared-Story bubble resolves its real owner via the new
  `GET /api/v1/stories/:id/owner` and opens it in `StoryViewer`,
  falling back to doing nothing if the Story's no longer accessible.
- `src/screens/dm/SendStoryScreen.tsx` — the "Send to a Katkee user" leg
  of the Share sheet: search for someone, tap to open (or reuse) the
  conversation with them and send the Story as a message. Reached from
  `ShareSheet.tsx` via a root → `Main` → `DM` → `SendStory` deep link
  (`StoryViewerScreen.tsx` holds the root-level navigation object;
  `ShareSheet` itself stays navigation-agnostic via an `onSendToUser`
  callback prop, the same pattern as its existing `onClose`).
- `src/state/DMContext.tsx` — mirrors `NotificationsContext.tsx` exactly:
  shares the DM tab's own unread count (independent of Activity's) with a
  matching amber badge on the DM tab icon, polling
  `GET /api/v1/conversations/unread-count` every 20s.
- `src/api/stories.ts`'s `getStoryOwnerUsername()` — the Phase 8 backend
  addition (`GET /api/v1/stories/:id/owner`) used by both the DM
  shared-Story bubble and, retroactively, `ActivityScreen.tsx`'s mention
  notifications (see "Phase 7 specifically" above).
- `src/components/HighlightsRow.tsx` — the row of Highlight bubbles under
  a profile's bio (spec section 35), rendered on both `ProfileScreen.tsx`
  (your own, with a leading "+ New" bubble) and `UserProfileScreen.tsx`
  (theirs, gated the same way the backend gates it — a private account's
  Highlights just don't load for a non-follower). A bubble's cover is a
  real thumbnail (`Image` with an `Authorization` header, the same
  pattern `StoryViewerScreen.tsx` already used), not a placeholder.
- `src/screens/highlight/HighlightEditorScreen.tsx` — create (no
  `highlightId`) or edit (rename/replace items/delete) a Highlight: a
  title field and a tap-to-select grid built from
  `GET /api/v1/stories/mine/archive` — every Story you've ever published,
  expired or not, which is the entire reason an Archive listing exists
  now (see backend/README.md's Phase 9 section). Selection order becomes
  the Highlight's item order, shown as a numbered badge per selected
  thumbnail.
- `src/screens/highlight/HighlightViewerScreen.tsx` — sequential,
  view-only playback of a Highlight's items, real media and a real
  per-item progress bar, reached by tapping a bubble. Deliberately its
  own, simpler screen rather than a mode on `StoryViewerScreen.tsx` — see
  "Phase 9 specifically" for why.
- `UserProfileScreen.tsx` also gained a real **Message** button next to
  Follow, now that DMs exist (Phase 8) — it opens or reuses the 1:1
  conversation with that user and navigates straight into it.
- `src/components/ReportSheet.tsx` — a shared reason-picker bottom sheet
  (the 7 backend-defined reasons, an optional details field) for
  reporting a Story, a comment, or a user account, posting a real
  `POST /api/v1/reports` that lands in the Phase 10 backend's moderation
  queue. React Native's built-in `Alert` can't reasonably list 7 options,
  so this is a small Modal in the same style as `ShareSheet.tsx`, not a
  new UI pattern.
- `StoryMoreMenu.tsx` gained a real **Report** row for someone else's
  Story (the placeholder note that used to be here — "needs a moderation
  queue that doesn't exist" — is exactly what Phase 10 built).
  `UserProfileScreen.tsx` gained a small **Report this account** link.
  `CommentsSheet.tsx` gained a **Report** action per comment that isn't
  your own, alongside the existing Delete.
- `src/config/env.ts` — a real dev/production split for the backend URL,
  selected automatically by React Native's own `__DEV__` global (true in
  a Metro/debug build, false in a release build) — no extra native module
  needed just to pick a URL. `api/client.ts`'s `API_BASE_URL` now reads
  from this instead of a hardcoded `localhost:4000`. Set
  `production.apiBaseUrl` to your real deployed backend's HTTPS domain
  (see `../DEPLOYMENT.md`) before making a release build.
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — a top-level crash boundary
  (wraps everything in `App.tsx`, outside even `AuthProvider`) so an
  unexpected render error shows a real, recoverable screen instead of a
  blank one. Reports through `src/crashReporting.ts`, which is inert
  (just `console.error`s) until you wire in a real service — that file's
  own comment is the exact `npm install`/wizard sequence for Sentry, the
  standard choice for React Native.
- `src/components/DeleteAccountSheet.tsx` — real, password-confirmed,
  in-app account deletion, reachable from `ProfileScreen.tsx`. This isn't
  optional polish: App Store review guideline 5.1.1(v) requires an
  in-app deletion path for any app that supports account creation, and a
  submission is rejected outright without one. Calls the Phase 12 backend
  endpoint through a new `AuthContext.deleteAccount()`, which clears
  local tokens and returns to signed-out on success — the same ending
  state as `logout()`, reached by a genuinely different, irreversible
  action.

### Phase 13 specifically

- **"Delivered" means "the recipient's client actually fetched it," not
  "pushed to their device."** There's no push/WebSocket channel in this
  build (see `backend/README.md`'s own sandbox-limitation notes for the
  same class of constraint elsewhere) — `ConversationScreen.tsx`'s 4s
  poll while a thread is open is the real-time approximation, and
  `Delivered` reflects a real fetch having happened, honestly scoped
  rather than faked as true push delivery. `pollForNew` only refreshes
  status on the most recent `PAGE_SIZE` (30) messages — a status caption
  older than that won't progress past whatever it showed on last fetch,
  which is fine in practice since a status caption only ever renders on
  the single most recent message anyway.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering no longer conflicts with a scrolling
  ancestor — fixed, not just documented.** `src/components/DraggableGrid.tsx`
  is a hand-rolled long-press-to-drag grid (`PanResponder`, no
  `react-native-gesture-handler` — not installable here, same
  npm-registry constraint as everywhere else in this project). Detecting
  "held still, not moving, for 300ms" requires claiming the touch
  responder at touch-*down*, before any movement exists to judge — there
  was no way to defer that decision until motion happens without
  gesture-handler's simultaneous-recognizer support, which is why this
  used to just accept that a scroll starting on a Highlight card wouldn't
  scroll the page. The actual fix: a new `draggable` prop (default
  `true`) that, when `false`, never attaches a PanResponder to any item
  at all — an ordinary `<Pressable>` instead, so an ancestor `ScrollView`
  scrolls exactly as if the grid weren't there. `HighlightsRow.tsx` uses
  this for a real **Reorder** toggle (visible only to the owner, only
  when there's more than one Highlight): drag is off by default (the
  profile page scrolls completely normally), and only turns on for the
  window between tapping "Reorder" and "Done" — during which
  `ProfileScreen.tsx`/`UserProfileScreen.tsx` also disable their own
  `ScrollView`'s `scrollEnabled` via a new `onReorderModeChange` callback,
  so there's nothing ambiguous for either gesture to fight over.
  `HighlightEditorScreen.tsx`'s "selected, in order" strip isn't inside a
  ScrollView at all, so it stays permanently draggable (the prop's
  default) — no toggle needed there.
- **Story Insights' "following vs. discovery" split is now a real
  snapshot from view time, not a live lookup.** `story_views` gained a
  real `was_following` column (migration `0014_story_view_follow_snapshot.sql`),
  set once at the moment of a viewer's *first* view of a Story and never
  touched again — so someone who viewed as a stranger and followed five
  minutes later still correctly shows as discovery, not following (see
  `backend/README.md`'s Phase 13 section, and a new backend test that
  proves exactly this — follow after viewing, confirm the numbers didn't
  move). "Profile visits" still reuses the existing creator-scoped
  `profile_visit` event (a viewer counts if they ever visited your
  profile, not provably *because of* this specific Story) — that one's a
  real, disclosed approximation, not a bug to fix, since there's no
  per-Story causal link for a profile visit to snapshot in the first
  place. `SequenceInsightsScreen.tsx` still has no viewer-identity list
  at all (only `StoryInsightsSheet.tsx`, per-Story, does) — an aggregate
  cross-Story identity list is a genuinely separate feature this pass
  doesn't add.

### Phase 12 specifically

- **No new native modules, no ios/android folders yet.** Everything
  Phase 12 needed was achievable in plain TypeScript/React Native — see
  `../DEPLOYMENT.md` for the real bootstrap step (`npx
  @react-native-community/cli@latest init`) that finally creates those,
  on your own machine, when you're ready to build for real.
- **Crash reporting is a real integration point, not a real crash
  reporter.** `crashReporting.ts` is inert until you actually run `npm
  install @sentry/react-native` (or swap in Bugsnag/Crashlytics) — see
  that file's own comment for the exact steps. Shipping a hardcoded
  Sentry DSN (or any real credential) into this repo would be a real
  security mistake, not a shortcut worth taking to look more "done."

### Phase 11 specifically

- **No new files, no new UI — and that's not a gap.** Phase 11 was the
  backend's production hardening (rate limiting, structured logging, a
  real DB-backed health check, startup config validation — see
  backend/README.md's Phase 11 section). None of that needed a mobile
  change because the error-handling plumbing built all the way back in
  Phase 1 already does the right thing by construction: `api/client.ts`'s
  `request()` already turns any non-2xx JSON response's `message` field
  into an `ApiError`, and every screen that calls `login`/`signup`
  already catches `ApiError` and shows `err.message` — so a 429 rate-limit
  response (`{"error":"http_error","message":"Too many requests — try
  again in 898s."}`) already surfaces to the user correctly, verified by
  reading that code path rather than assumed. That's a real payoff of
  having kept error shapes consistent across nine prior phases, not
  something added for Phase 11 specifically.

### Phase 10 specifically

- **No mobile moderator queue.** The backend's
  `GET /api/v1/moderation/reports` and resolve/suspend endpoints are
  real and tested, but there's no admin screen in this app to drive them
  — moderators are expected to be a tiny internal cohort, and building a
  dedicated review UI for that audience didn't earn its place in this
  pass over the user-facing Report flow itself. See backend/README.md's
  Phase 10 section for the same call spelled out on that side.
- **Reporting doesn't visibly change what you see afterward.** Filing a
  report shows a "thanks, we'll review this" confirmation and nothing
  else — it doesn't hide the reported content, mute the account, or
  otherwise change your own feed (that's what Block/Mute are for, and
  they're unaffected by this). A report is a signal to moderators, not a
  personal filter.

### Phase 9 specifically

- **Highlight playback is view-only — no like, comment, share, or view
  recording.** `StoryViewerScreen.tsx`'s equivalents all go through the
  *normal* per-Story endpoints (`getStoryDetail`, `recordStoryView`,
  `likeStory`, …), every one of which enforces the 24h expiry a Highlight
  exists specifically to outlive — reusing them here would have meant
  threading an expiry-bypass through each one individually on the
  backend. A Highlight is about persisting visibility, not full
  interactive parity with a live Story, so this pass keeps
  `HighlightViewerScreen.tsx` deliberately read-only; it's real, tested
  playback, just a narrower feature than the live viewer.
- ~~No drag-to-reorder in the editor~~ **Fixed in a later pass.** The
  selected-items strip is a `DraggableGrid` (long-press and drag), the
  same component the profile's own Highlights row reorder mode uses —
  item order is a real drag handle now, not just tap order.
- ~~The Archive picker loads one page with no "load more"~~ **Fixed in a
  later pass.** `HighlightEditorScreen.tsx`'s Archive picker now paginates
  the same way `ArchiveScreen.tsx` always did (`onEndReached`, a footer
  spinner, `ARCHIVE_PAGE_SIZE` at a time) — a prolific account's older
  Stories past the first page are reachable now.

### Phase 8 specifically

- **Messaging is polled, not pushed.** An open conversation polls every
  4s for new messages (tighter than Activity/DM's 20s badge polling,
  since the user is actively looking at the screen) — there's no
  push/websocket channel in this sandbox (see backend/README.md). A real
  chat product would want a persistent connection; this is the honest
  approximation available here, not a stub.
- **A "Shared a Story" bubble that's no longer accessible just does
  nothing when tapped**, rather than showing an error — the owner-lookup
  call fails the same way `getStoryForViewer` would for any expired,
  deleted, or since-privacy-changed Story, and silently no-opping felt
  better than surfacing a confusing error for something the recipient
  has no way to act on anyway.
- **Group DMs aren't here** — see backend/README.md for why the schema
  itself is 1:1-only for this pass, not just the UI.
- **No typing indicator, read receipts beyond the unread dot, or message
  deletion/editing.** The spec's DM sections don't call for the first two
  as hard requirements the way the core send/receive/share loop is, and
  message deletion wasn't in this pass's scope — a real, testable slice
  (send, receive, share a Story, know what's unread) over a wider shallow
  one.

### Phase 7 specifically

- **A mention notification on a Story you don't own couldn't deep-link
  straight to that Story — fixed in Phase 8.** For like/comment
  notifications the recipient is always the Story's owner, so the
  viewer's own username was always enough to reopen it. A mention's
  recipient is just whoever got @-mentioned in a comment, though — the
  Story underneath it could belong to anyone — and there was no
  "look up a Story's owner by id" call. Phase 8 added one
  (`GET /api/v1/stories/:id/owner`, needed for the DM shared-Story bubble
  anyway) and wired it into `ActivityScreen.tsx`'s mention handler; it
  falls back to opening the actor's profile only if that lookup itself
  fails (e.g. the Story has since expired).
- ~~There's no screen for managing incoming follow requests yet~~ **Fixed
  in a later pass.** `FollowRequestsScreen.tsx` (reached from Settings >
  Privacy > "Follow requests," with a live pending-count badge) lists
  every incoming request and lets you accept or decline each one, backed
  by the same `GET /api/v1/follow-requests` /
  `POST /api/v1/follow-requests/:id/accept|decline` that had existed
  since Phase 2 with no mobile screen against them. Tapping a
  `follow_request` notification still just opens the requester's profile
  rather than deep-linking into this screen — a smaller, cosmetic gap,
  not the missing-feature one this note originally flagged.
- **The unread badge is polled, not pushed**, per the
  `NotificationsContext.tsx` note above — a 20s worst-case staleness
  window, not a stub.

### Phase 4 specifically

- **Video duration for the progress bar comes from the player, not the
  server.** The backend doesn't parse a video's real duration yet (see
  `backend/README.md` — that needs `ffmpeg`, which the sandbox's network
  policy refused), so the viewer waits for `react-native-video`'s own
  `onLoad` to report the real duration before starting that segment's
  progress bar, falling back to a 15s guess only if that never fires.
- **Knowing whether a Story's media is a photo or video** now uses a real
  `GET /api/v1/media/:id` metadata lookup (Phase 4 also opened that
  endpoint up beyond owner-only — see `backend/README.md`) rather than
  guessing from a file extension.

### Phase 5 specifically

- **The copied/shared link is real but inert.** `ShareSheet.tsx` builds a
  `katkee://story/:id` deep link — correct scheme, correct id — but
  Universal Links (iOS) / App Links (Android) aren't configured in the
  (nonexistent) native projects, so tapping that link on a device won't
  open the app yet. That native configuration is a real, separate step;
  the link format itself isn't a placeholder.
- **"Send to a Katkee user" isn't in the Share sheet.** Spec section 15
  lists it alongside Copy Link and native share, but it needs a
  conversation to send it into — DMs are Phase 8. Offering a picker that
  saved to nothing would be fake functionality.
- **"Not Interested" and "Report" aren't in the More menu.** The spec
  lists them (section 16), but "Not Interested" is a recommendation
  signal with no recommender to feed yet (Phase 6), and "Report" needs
  a moderation queue that doesn't exist (Phase 11). Mute and Block —
  the two items that already have a real backend — are there and work.
- **Haptic feedback on like uses `Vibration.vibrate()`**, React Native's
  built-in API, rather than a dedicated haptics package — this sandbox
  can't install one, and a short vibration is a real (if blunter)
  substitute for a haptic tick, not a stub.
- **The hand-rolled tap/double-tap/hold/swipe recognizer in
  `StoryViewerScreen.tsx`** is now doing more at once than Phase 4's
  version (it also has to not mistake a double-tap-to-like for two
  single taps) — worth deliberately testing on a real device before
  trusting the timing values (`HOLD_DELAY_MS`, `DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS`,
  `SWIPE_CLOSE_THRESHOLD`) feel right, not just that they compile.

### Phase 3 specifically

Two things are honestly scoped down rather than faked:

- **Filters are preview-only.** `src/models/filterPreviews.ts` applies a
  color-tint `View` over the live preview so the picker actually does
  something on screen, but it does **not** bake the filter into the
  exported file's pixels — spec section 23 ("filters must actually modify
  media") needs either a native image-processing module or a server-side
  pass, and the backend can't do that here either (see
  `backend/README.md` — `apt-get install ffmpeg` was refused by the same
  network policy that blocks npm). The chosen filter name is still saved
  on the `StoryDraft`, so wiring up a real renderer later doesn't touch
  the editor's UI or state.
- **Stickers, drawing, mentions, and location are not in this pass.**
  Spec sections 21/22/24/25 are real scope for the Story editor, but
  given how much of this phase (camera + multitouch overlay gestures) is
  already impossible to verify without a device, adding several more
  unverified subsystems in one pass seemed like the wrong tradeoff. Text
  overlays are real and complete (drag, pinch-resize, rotate, delete,
  edit); the rest is a natural next slice.
- **The editor's action was "Upload," not "Share Story," in this phase.**
  Phase 4 added real publishing underneath it — see below — so the button
  now says "Share Story" and actually is one.

### Phase 6 specifically

- **`follow_after_story` isn't emitted at all.** It would need correlating
  "the viewer just followed someone" (which happens in
  `UserProfileScreen.tsx`, a completely different screen) with "they were
  recently viewing that creator's Story" — real attribution logic that
  doesn't exist yet, and guessing at it felt worse than leaving the event
  out. `repeat_creator_visit` similarly isn't client-emitted — the
  backend already derives it correctly from real `story_impression`
  timestamps spread across days (see `backend/README.md`), so a
  redundant client event would just be double-bookkeeping.
- **`story_replay` isn't emitted.** There's no "go back to the start of a
  Story you've already finished" affordance in this viewer (tapping left
  only moves to the previous Story in the sequence, never re-plays the
  current one from 0) — nothing to attach the event to yet.
- **Every event call is fire-and-forget** (`recordEvent(...).catch(() =>
  undefined)`) — a dropped analytics call degrades ranking quality over
  time, never the viewing experience in the moment. That's a deliberate
  tradeoff, not an oversight.

## Known sandbox limitation (read this first)

This session's network policy blocks `registry.npmjs.org`, so `npm install`
could not run here — meaning `react`, `react-native`, and
`@react-navigation/*` were never actually resolved, and this code has not
been properly typechecked, built, or run. As a partial, best-effort check,
`tsc` was run directly against every file with real library types stubbed
out (so most of its output is expected "cannot find module react-native"
noise, not real findings) — it still caught one genuine bug worth knowing
about: `StoryEditorScreen.tsx`'s error-message style spread `typography.caption`
*after* setting `color: colors.danger`, so the spread's own gray silently
overwrote the intended red. Fixed. That's the kind of thing this technique
can catch (property-order bugs, obvious type mismatches) and the kind it
can't (anything needing real React Native/library type information, or
anything only wrong at runtime on a device). Separately, React Native requires Xcode
(iOS) and/or the Android SDK plus a physical or emulated device to build and
run at all — no cloud sandbox provides that, so real-device testing was
always going to happen on your hardware regardless of network access (see
the KATKEE build-plan doc, section on real-device testing).

This is also not yet a fully bootstrapped React Native project — there are
no native `android/`/`ios/` folders, `metro.config.js`, or Gradle/Xcode
project files. Those are ordinarily generated by the React Native CLI
itself; hand-writing them would be far more likely to produce broken
boilerplate than real value, so they're intentionally left for the actual
bootstrap step below rather than faked.

## To actually run this, on a machine with the RN toolchain installed

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init KatkeeMobile --skip-install
# then copy this package's src/, App.tsx, index.js, app.json, babel.config.js,
# tsconfig.json, and package.json dependencies into the generated project
cd KatkeeMobile
npm install
npm run typecheck   # do this first — this code has never been typechecked
npm run ios         # or: npm run android
```

Point `API_BASE_URL` in `src/api/client.ts` at your backend (the iOS
simulator can reach `localhost:4000` directly; Android emulators need
`10.0.2.2:4000`; a physical device needs your machine's LAN IP).

Phase 3 additionally needs, once the native projects exist:

- **iOS** (`ios/KatkeeMobile/Info.plist`): `NSCameraUsageDescription`,
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, and `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
  (gallery import) — `react-native-vision-camera` and
  `react-native-image-picker` both refuse to function without these.
- **Android** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`): the `CAMERA`
  and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions.
- `react-native-vision-camera` requires iOS 13+ and may need a `Podfile`
  tweak per its own install docs (frame processors, if ever used, need
  `react-native-worklets-core` — not added here since nothing in this
  pass uses frame processors).
- **Location sticker** (`@react-native-community/geolocation`, added for
  the Camera + Editor module below) additionally needs, once the native
  projects exist: iOS `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`,
  and Android's `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission in the manifest (the app
  also requests it at runtime via `PermissionsAndroid`, but the manifest
  entry is what makes that request possible at all).

Camera capture, the pinch/rotate/drag-to-zoom multitouch handling, and
video playback are exactly the kind of code that most needs real-device
testing (spec section 56) before trusting it — none of that happened in
this session.

## Camera + Editor module: what's real, what's approximated, what needs a device

A full rewrite of Story capture and editing (mobile/src/screens/create/,
mobile/src/components/Draggable*, OverlayBody.tsx, StickerSheet.tsx,
DrawingCanvas.tsx, StoryOverlayLayer.tsx) against a big, explicit spec —
here's an honest accounting.

**Real, and now actually persists (the headline bug fix):** overlays and
the chosen filter used to vanish on publish — `StoryEditorScreen.onShare`
built a `StoryDraft` the editor could preview but never sent any of it to
the backend. Every canvas object type (text, emoji, mention, location,
date/time, sticker) is now stored as structured JSON on the Story
(`backend` migration `0015_story_overlays.sql`), round-trips through
publish, and renders live — with the same `OverlayBody` component the
editor itself uses, so what you see while editing is what actually
publishes — in every viewer (`StoryFeed.tsx`, `ArchivedStoryViewerScreen.tsx`,
`HighlightViewerScreen.tsx`) via the shared `StoryOverlayLayer.tsx`.

**Real: one gesture model for every object type.** `DraggableCanvasObject.tsx`
(the file that used to be `DraggableTextOverlay.tsx` — same technique,
generalized) drives drag/pinch/rotate/double-tap/drag-to-delete for text,
emoji, mentions, location and date/time chips, and stickers alike, still
on hand-rolled `PanResponder` math with zero new gesture dependencies.
`CameraScreen.tsx`'s own pinch-to-zoom was rewritten the same way to close
a real bug: it previously imported `PinchGestureHandler` from
`react-native-gesture-handler`, a package never actually declared in
`package.json` — it would have failed to resolve on a real build. Rather
than add that (and `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-svg`) as new
native dependencies, this pass stayed consistent with the rest of the
project's zero-dependency multitouch pattern: two-finger pinch-zoom on the
preview and a new one-finger record-and-drag-to-zoom on the capture button
itself (spec section 18) are both hand-rolled `PanResponder`s, with a
temporary "Nx" zoom badge.

**The exact same phantom-dependency bug survived at the app root, found
during a later full-app audit.** `App.tsx` still wrapped the whole tree in
`<GestureHandlerRootView>` from `react-native-gesture-handler` — the
CameraScreen fix above removed the library's only real usage but left
this root-level setup wrapper behind, still importing a package that was
never in `package.json` and still isn't used anywhere in this codebase.
It would have failed to resolve on a real build the same way the old
`PinchGestureHandler` import would have. Removed; `App.tsx` no longer
imports `react-native-gesture-handler` at all. Caught by cross-referencing
every `import ... from "<package>"` in `src/`, `App.tsx`, and `index.js`
against `package.json`'s actual `dependencies` — a check worth re-running
after any future gesture work, since this is the second time it's caught
exactly this mistake.

**Real: mentions are structural, not baked-in text.** A mention overlay
stores only `{userId}`; the backend re-resolves it to a live
`username`/`displayName` on every read, dropping it entirely if the
account was deleted or either side has blocked the other since publish —
verified by five backend tests (`backend/test/stories.test.ts`'s "Camera +
Editor" describe block), not just asserted. Tapping a published mention
navigates to that user's real profile.

**Real: drawing, with undo/redo, no SVG library.** `DrawingCanvas.tsx`
samples touch points into normalized strokes; `DrawingStrokes.tsx` renders
them as chains of thin rotated `View`s between consecutive points (the
standard SVG-free polyline technique), shared between the live editor and
the read-only viewer. Undo/redo is a local stack, not a full history
system, per spec. The eraser is real but simplified: it removes whole
strokes your finger passes over rather than trimming them pixel-by-pixel —
there's no pixel layer under this component for a paint-over eraser to
work with, and whole-stroke erase is a normal, honest interpretation of
"undo what you drew here."

**Real but a deliberate simplification: location.** Device location is
requested only when you explicitly tap "Location" in the sticker sheet —
never on the editor simply opening — using the real, newly-declared
`@react-native-community/geolocation` API (same "declared, not yet
installed or run in this sandbox" status as vision-camera, image-picker,
and video). There's no Maps/Places API key configured anywhere in this
project, so there's no reverse-geocoding: "Use current location" fills in
a coarse, rounded coordinate label (~1km precision, never the raw
full-precision reading) that you can edit or replace with your own text
before it's ever attached to the Story.

**Approximated, disclosed, and unchanged from before this module:** the 11
named filters are still semi-transparent color-tint overlays
(`models/filterPreviews.ts`), not real pixel-level color grading — that
needs either a native image-processing module or a server-side pass
(ffmpeg), neither available in this sandbox. What changed is that the
chosen filter now actually reaches the backend and renders at view time
instead of being silently dropped; what didn't change is that it's still
an approximation of the real effect, exactly as before.

**Not attempted:** custom illustrated sticker artwork (the "Katkee
original stickers" are Unicode glyphs, not drawn assets — a real illustration
pipeline is outside what a text-only sandbox session can produce);
frame-accurate audio sync verification for zoom-while-recording (the
recording/zoom code path is real, but only on-device testing can confirm
audio actually stays in sync — see spec section 45's own test plan,
unrun here); and, as with the rest of this project, any of it actually
running on a device.

### Video/audio: the mute toggle now actually publishes, and overlay sync needs no extra code

The editor's mute/unmute control (spec section 44) had exactly the same
bug overlays and the filter choice did: `StoryEditorScreen` toggled a
`videoMuted` state that only ever affected its own `<Video muted={...}>`
preview — nothing sent it to the backend, so a Story muted in the editor
still published with its original audio. Fixed the same way: it's now
`draft.audioMuted`, sent on publish (backend migration `0016`), and read
back by every viewer's own `<Video muted={...}>` (`StoryFeed.tsx`,
`ArchivedStoryViewerScreen.tsx`, `HighlightViewerScreen.tsx`) instead of
each hardcoding `false`.

"Overlays stay synced over the video timeline" (spec section 44) turns
out to need no new code at all, once you look at how overlays are already
stored: every overlay's `x`/`y`/`scale`/`rotation` is a static value
normalized to the media container's box (see `storyDraft.ts`), not
keyframed to a particular video timestamp — an overlay doesn't move
*during* playback, it sits in one place for the Story's whole duration,
the same way it would over a photo. Since the editor's preview and every
viewer both render that same normalized position through the same
`OverlayBody` component, over a `<Video resizeMode="cover">` that's sized
identically in both places, "the overlay is in the same spot at every
point in the video" was already true by construction — there was no
separate timeline-sync mechanism to build or that could drift.

### Accessibility: what's real, and what's still gesture-only

Spec: "gesture-only interaction must have an accessible alternative where
needed." What's actually built:

- **Reduced Motion** (`hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`, reading the OS setting
  live via `AccessibilityInfo`): the double-tap-to-like heart burst in
  `StoryFeed.tsx` collapses to an instant flash instead of a scaling/fading
  animation when it's on. The auto-advance progress bar's own timing is
  left alone deliberately — it's the mechanism that decides when the next
  Story shows, not decoration, so "reducing" it would break the feature.
- **Screen-reader labels, roles, and selection state** on every icon-only
  control this module added or touched: Camera's flash/timer/flip/gallery/
  close, the editor's Text/Stickers/Draw/mute buttons and filter/audience
  chips, the sticker sheet's tabs/emoji/stickers/mention results, the text
  tool's style/align/color/size controls, and the drawing tool's
  tool/color/size/undo/redo controls.
- **A real, working non-gesture path for every canvas-object manipulation**
  (`OverlayAdjustSheet.tsx`): tapping an object opens directional nudge
  buttons for position, +/- for scale and rotation, and a Delete button —
  standing in for one-finger drag, two-finger pinch-and-twist, and
  drag-to-trash respectively, reachable through ordinary button activation.
  Text additionally gets an "Edit Text" button into the existing style
  editor. Because a screen reader intercepts raw touches for its own
  navigation, `DraggableCanvasObject.tsx` also wires this up as a real
  `accessibilityAction` ("activate"), not just a touch handler with a
  label — the same technique the camera's capture button uses for "take
  photo" / "record video" as explicit actions rather than relying on the
  hold-to-record gesture reaching a screen reader at all.
- **Touch targets**: every canvas object gets a 16px `hitSlop` on top of
  its visible size, so a small emoji or a tightly-scaled sticker still has
  a reasonably sized hit area.

**Not attempted, and disclosed rather than faked:** high-contrast mode isn't specifically tested against (the existing
color tokens already have strong contrast by design — see `../BRAND.md` —
but nothing here verifies WCAG ratios against every combination); and
none of this has been exercised with an actual screen reader on a real
device, which is the only way to know for certain whether VoiceOver/
TalkBack really do route to the `accessibilityActions` this code declares
rather than fighting the `PanResponder` underneath them.

### Four more spec items closed: safe bounds, text wrap, keyboard handling, swipe-to-cycle filters

- **"Objects must stay retrievable, not vanish off-canvas"**: nothing
  previously stopped a drag (or the new OverlayAdjustSheet's nudge
  buttons) from moving an object's anchor point fully outside the visible
  canvas — reachable neither by another drag nor by tapping to select it
  again. `storyDraft.ts`'s `clampOverlayPosition`/`OVERLAY_SAFE_MARGIN`
  (6% margin) is now applied in both places. The backend's own `dto.ts`
  clamp is deliberately looser (`-0.1..1.1`, a sanity backstop against an
  arbitrary API caller) — the two are different jobs, not a mismatch.
- **Auto-wrap text**: a text overlay had no width constraint at all, so a
  long single-line caption just grew wider than the canvas indefinitely
  instead of wrapping. `OverlayBody.tsx` now caps it at 80% of the
  container's width, letting RN's own `Text` wrapping do the rest.
- **Keyboard handling that never hides Done/controls**: `TextToolModal`'s
  style/align/color/size rows sit below the text input with no
  keyboard-avoidance at all before this — an opening keyboard on a real
  device would have covered all of them. It's now wrapped in a
  `KeyboardAvoidingView` (`padding` on iOS; Android's own window resize
  already handles it, `height` there is just a safety net).
- **Swipe-to-cycle filters with a briefly-shown name**: filters could only
  be picked from the horizontal chip strip — spec section 24 also asks for
  a swipe gesture on the media itself, with the filter's name flashing
  briefly. Added as a `PanResponder` layer that sits *beneath* every
  canvas object in paint order (rendered earlier in JSX), so a touch that
  starts on an object is claimed by that object's own gesture first (RN's
  topmost-sibling hit-testing) — "suppressed while actively manipulating a
  text/sticker object" falls out of that ordering rather than needing a
  separate flag to track it. Not rendered in draw mode, and every modal
  (text tool, sticker sheet, overlay adjust) already blocks all touches to
  the screen beneath it while open, so those cases needed no extra
  handling either.

### Five more closed: crop, crash-safe drafts, a real date/time picker

- **Crop** (`StoryDraft.crop`, backend migration `0017`): the one field in
  the spec's own `StoryDraft` shape this project hadn't built. No
  image-processing library exists in this sandbox to re-encode cropped
  pixels, so — same architecture as filter/overlays/drawing — crop is
  `{zoom, offsetX, offsetY}` metadata applied as a live transform
  (`storyDraft.ts`'s `mediaTransformStyle`) in the editor **and** every
  viewer, never baked into the media file. `CropGestureLayer.tsx` is a
  dedicated pinch-to-zoom/drag-to-pan mode (like Draw), hand-rolled on
  `PanResponder` with no new dependency; offsets are stored as a fraction
  of the *pan room available at the current zoom*, not raw pixels, so a
  crop looks the same at any container size.
- **Crash-safe local drafts** (`state/draftStorage.ts`): the spec's own
  publish flow lists "persist local draft" as a step before upload, not
  just React state — this project only had the latter until now. The
  in-progress draft autosaves to `AsyncStorage` (already a real,
  declared dependency) keyed by the media's own URI, debounced, and is
  restored automatically if `StoryEditorScreen` remounts on that same
  file (an app crash or reload mid-edit or mid-upload). Cleared on a
  successful publish and on a confirmed discard.
- **A real date/time picker**: the sticker sheet's Date/Time tab used to
  only offer "today"/"now". It's now a hand-rolled +/- stepper on
  day/hour/minute with a live preview — no calendar-picker dependency
  declared, since steppers are a complete, functional answer for a Story
  sticker (which only ever needs "some date," not scheduling precision).
- **`StickerSheet`'s mention search** had the exact keyboard-covering-the-
  results-list gap `TextToolModal` had — same `KeyboardAvoidingView` fix,
  applied here too.
- **Two real-device manual test plans**, written up as actual checklists
  rather than only described: [`MANUAL_TEST_PLAN_CAMERA.md`](./MANUAL_TEST_PLAN_CAMERA.md)
  and [`MANUAL_TEST_PLAN_EDITOR.md`](./MANUAL_TEST_PLAN_EDITOR.md). Run
  these on a real device before trusting any of this module — nothing in
  it has executed outside this sandbox.

**Still open:** as always, none of the above has actually run — the two
test plans above are what "run" would mean.

### Camera tap-to-focus now has an accessible alternative

~~Camera tap-to-focus has no button alternative~~ **Fixed in a later
pass.** The preview `View` (`CameraScreen.tsx`) now declares
`accessibilityActions` — "Focus camera" and "Flip camera" — reachable
through the same custom-actions menu the capture button's own
`accessibilityActions` already used, rather than only through the raw
tap/double-tap gesture a screen reader intercepts before `PanResponder`
ever sees it. "Focus camera" focuses the center of the preview's own
measured layout (captured via `onLayout`), not a guessed constant, so it's
correct at any device size. Most devices' continuous autofocus already
makes precise focus placement a bonus rather than the only way to get a
usable shot, which is why this sat as a disclosed gap rather than a
blocker — but a real accessible path now exists either way.

### Crop now has a non-gesture path too — an undisclosed gap this pass caught

`OverlayAdjustSheet.tsx` explicitly scopes itself to "canvas-object
manipulation" (text/emoji/mention/location/datetime/sticker overlays); the
crop tool is a separate editor mode with its own `CropGestureLayer.tsx`
(pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan), and nothing had ever given *it* a non-gesture
equivalent — a real, undisclosed accessibility gap, found on inspection
rather than reported by anyone. `CropAdjustControls.tsx` closes it: zoom
+/- and a directional pan pad, plus a one-tap Reset back to `{zoom: 1,
offsetX: 0, offsetY: 0}`, shown in the editor's crop mode alongside the
existing "Pinch to zoom · Drag to reposition" hint and Done button. Both
the buttons and the gesture layer route every change through the same
`clampCrop`, so a button nudge and an actual pinch/drag can never disagree
about what a valid crop is. The freehand drawing tool remains the one
deliberate exception with no non-gesture equivalent — there's no
accessible way to author a freehand stroke without a finger path, the same
way there isn't in any drawing app, so this is a permanent, honest limit
rather than an oversight.

### Drag-to-reorder had the exact same gap — also fixed

`DraggableGrid.tsx` (Highlights' own order in `HighlightsRow.tsx`, and a
Highlight's item order in `HighlightEditorScreen.tsx`'s selected strip)
had **zero** accessibility props at all before this — not even a label,
let alone an alternative to the long-press-and-drag gesture itself. A
screen-reader user had no way to reorder anything through either surface.
Each item in reorder mode now exposes `accessibilityActions` ("Move
earlier/later in order"), handled by a new `onMoveStep` that moves the
item exactly one slot and commits immediately through the same `onReorder`
a drag's release already calls — a screen-reader user gets a slower,
one-step-at-a-time equivalent, not a dead end. Both call sites needed no
changes themselves; the fix is entirely inside `DraggableGrid.tsx`.

### The single biggest undisclosed gap: the Story feed itself had no accessible navigation at all

`StoryFeed.tsx` is the app's actual core loop — tap left/right to move
between Stories, double-tap to like, hold to pause, swipe up/down to move
between creators — and every one of those, before this fix, was reachable
only through its `PanResponder` gesture recognizer. Nothing here had ever
been given an accessible alternative, and unlike the crop tool or
drag-to-reorder above, this one was never disclosed as a gap either: a
screen-reader user could open Home and reach the like/comment/share/more
buttons (those were already properly accessible), but had **no way at all**
to actually move to the next Story, the previous Story, or a different
creator — the single most central interaction in the entire product.

The fix isn't as simple as marking the existing container `accessible`,
though: `gesture.panHandlers` sat on the *outer* `View` that also directly
contains the progress bar, the action rail, the footer, and the close
button as siblings — marking that container accessible would have
collapsed all of those already-working buttons into one opaque node,
trading one gap for a worse one. Instead, the gesture recognizer now lives
on its own dedicated `StyleSheet.absoluteFill` layer, inserted *beneath*
`StoryOverlayLayer` in paint order (rendered earlier in JSX) — the same
"topmost-sibling hit-testing" technique the editor's own swipe-to-cycle-
filter layer already relies on relative to canvas objects, so a tap on a
mention overlay is still claimed by the mention's own touch target first,
never by this layer. That layer declares `accessibilityActions` for the
four moves that matter — next/previous Story, next/previous creator —
each calling the exact same `goNextStory`/`goPreviousStory`/
`goNextCreator`/`goPreviousCreator` and analytics `emit(...)` calls the
gesture handler itself already used, so an accessibility-driven navigation
is indistinguishable from a gestural one in every system that consumes it
(recommendations, insights). Double-tap-to-like isn't duplicated here
deliberately — the action rail's own "Like"/"Unlike" button already covers
that intent through an ordinary, already-accessible `Pressable`.

### A sweep for smaller accessibility gaps the icon pass left behind

Auditing every gesture surface turned up a handful of smaller,
easy-to-miss gaps in files the earlier accessibility and icon passes
never actually touched:

- **`HighlightViewerScreen.tsx` and `ArchivedStoryViewerScreen.tsx`** were
  never migrated to the shared `ICONS` glyph module at all (still using
  raw `"✎"`/`"✕"` strings), and none of their buttons — Edit, Close, and
  the previous/next tap zones — had an `accessibilityLabel`. Both are now
  on `ICONS.edit`/`ICONS.close`, with real labels throughout ("Previous
  item", "Next item", "Edit Highlight", "Close").
- **Every modal's tap-outside-to-dismiss backdrop** (`ShareSheet.tsx`,
  `CommentsSheet.tsx`, `StoryInsightsSheet.tsx`, `StoryMoreMenu.tsx`,
  `ReportSheet.tsx`, `DeleteAccountSheet.tsx`) was an unlabeled, still-
  focusable `Pressable` — a screen reader would land on it and announce
  only "button," with no indication of what it does. `StickerSheet.tsx`
  and `OverlayAdjustSheet.tsx` already had this right (`accessibilityRole
  ="button" accessibilityLabel="Close"`); the other six now match that
  existing, correct convention instead of it being applied inconsistently.
- **The Story-ring avatar Pressable** on both `ProfileScreen.tsx` and
  `UserProfileScreen.tsx` had a `Text` child that was just a single
  initial letter (e.g. "R") — a screen reader's default behavior of
  reading a Pressable's visible text as its label meant this announced as
  "R, button" with no indication it opens a Story. Both now get a real,
  conditional label ("Open your Story" / "Open {name}'s Story" when there
  is one to open, otherwise just the name).

### Muting and blocking were one-way doors — a cross-reference against every backend route caught it

Cross-referencing every backend route against what mobile actually calls
(rather than trusting the per-feature disclosures written when each phase
shipped) turned up a real, functional gap, not just an accessibility one:
`StoryMoreMenu.tsx`'s "Mute @user"/"Block @user" only ever called
`muteUser`/`blockUser`. The backend's `DELETE /api/v1/users/:username/mute`
and `.../block` (unmute/unblock) have existed and been tested since Phase
2, and so has `GET /api/v1/blocks`/`GET /api/v1/mutes` (the lists), but
**nothing in this app ever called any of the four** — once you muted or
blocked someone, there was no screen anywhere to review or undo it. This
is a distinct gap from the "Mute and Block... are there and work" note
above — that one only ever meant the one-way mute/block *action* itself.

Fixed with two new screens, `BlockedAccountsScreen.tsx` and
`MutedAccountsScreen.tsx` (reached from Settings > Privacy), each backed
by the corresponding list endpoint with a per-row Unblock/Unmute button.
The per-Story "More" menu itself stays a simple one-way action sheet
deliberately — it has no profile data in scope to know whether someone's
already muted, and adding that round-trip to an ephemeral action sheet
didn't seem worth it once a real management screen exists elsewhere; the
same "action in the moment, review/undo in Settings" split most social
apps already use.

### The follower/following counts have looked tappable since Phase 1 — they never were

The same route cross-reference turned up one more: every profile
(`ProfileScreen.tsx`, `UserProfileScreen.tsx`) has shown a bold follower
count and a bold following count since Phase 1, styled and laid out
exactly like a tappable stat — but neither `Pressable` nor `onPress` was
ever attached to either one. `GET /api/v1/users/:username/followers` and
`.../following` have both existed and been tested since Phase 2. Fixed
with one shared `FollowListScreen.tsx` (both directions are the same
shape and the same `assertCanViewConnections` access rule on the
backend), reached by tapping either count on either profile screen; each
row in the list navigates to that user's own profile the same way a
search result does.

### Edit-in-place for location and date/time content

Double-tap-to-re-edit (spec section 20) was explicitly a text-only
requirement, but the same gap existed in spirit for location and date/time
stickers: once placed, the only way to change a mistyped location label or
a wrong date/time was delete-and-recreate. `StickerSheet` now accepts an
`editingOverlay`, pre-fills the relevant tab from it, hides the other tabs
while editing, and calls a new `onEditDone` (merging into the *existing*
overlay's `properties`, leaving its position/scale/rotation untouched)
instead of `onAdd`. Reachable two ways, matching the text pattern exactly:
double-tapping the object directly, or "Edit Location"/"Edit Date/Time" in
OverlayAdjustSheet — so it's available through the accessible,
non-gesture path too, not just the double-tap gesture.

## Icon set pass

Against a supplied "Katkee Icon Set" reference sheet (bottom nav, story
actions, camera, story editor, owner controls, search, activity, DM,
profile, highlights, archive). There's no vector icon font or SVG icon
library installed (same network-blocked-npm-install constraint as
everywhere else in this project), so every icon is a plain Unicode glyph
rendered through `Text` — now centralized in `theme/icons.ts` (`ICONS`)
instead of each screen inlining its own "✕"/"⚡"/etc., which is what every
file below was doing before this pass.

**Updated to match the reference:**
- **Bottom navigation** — real icons (⌂/🔍/+/♡/💬/◉) above each label;
  previously text-only labels with a focus dot.
- **Story action rail** — like/liked/comment/share/more, plus the owner's
  viewer-count button and the close button.
- **Camera screen** — Gallery and Flip were plain text buttons ("Gallery",
  "Flip"); Timer showed only a number. All three are icons now (Close and
  Flash already were).
- **Story editor top bar** — Text/Stickers/Draw/Crop/Audio were plain text
  buttons; now Aa/☺/✎/⛶/🔊 icons, and the trash-zone glyph and drawing
  tool's undo/redo now pull from the same shared constants.
- **Search** — added a leading search icon and a clear (✕) button to the
  existing input, which had neither.
- **DM conversation** — the "shared a Story" attachment marker and the
  Send button are icons now.
- **Highlights / Archive** — the "New Highlight" card, the Archive
  multi-select checkmark, and the Delete/Create Highlight actions now
  carry icons alongside their labels. Log out gets an exit icon.

**Initially deliberately not touched, then built for real in a follow-up
pass** (the icon pass above stopped at re-skinning what already existed;
the features below didn't exist yet, so adding their icons would have been
a fake button — they're now real screens/flows, not icon-only stubs):

- **Settings screen** (`SettingsScreen.tsx`) — a real hub: a Privacy switch
  wired to the existing `isPrivate` field on `PATCH /api/v1/users/me`;
  a link into **Notification Settings** (`NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx`),
  backed by a genuinely new backend table (migration 0018,
  `notification_preferences`) with real per-type (like/comment/follow/mention)
  toggles enforced at `notifications.repository.ts`'s single `createNotification`
  funnel point — turning one off actually suppresses that notification type
  at creation time, not a client-side filter of an unfiltered feed.
  `follow_request` is never in that list: it's an actionable pending
  request, not a muteable broadcast, so the backend never lets it be
  suppressed. Data & Storage is real too, in the one thing this app
  actually caches on-device: it shows a live count of crash-autosaved Story
  drafts (`draftStorage.ts`) and can wipe them. Help/About are real static
  content (an FAQ list, a version number) rather than placeholder text.
  Log Out and Delete Account moved here from the profile page itself,
  matching the reference. Privacy also links to a real **Follow Requests**
  inbox (`FollowRequestsScreen.tsx`, with a live pending-count badge) — see
  the Phase 7 gap list above for why that screen didn't exist until now.
- **Edit Profile** (`EditProfileScreen.tsx`) — display name and bio,
  wired to the same `PATCH /api/v1/users/me` the backend already supported.
- **Share Profile** — a native OS share sheet with a `katkee://user/<username>`
  deep link, same inert-until-native-linking-exists caveat as `ShareSheet.tsx`'s
  Story share link.
- **Activity tabs** (`ActivityScreen.tsx`) — All/Likes/Comments/Follows/Mentions
  tab bar, a client-side filter of the same unified feed (no backend
  change) — `follow_request` notifications live under the Follows tab
  alongside `follow`, since both are the same relationship concern.
- **Search filter** — an All/Following toggle. "Following" fetches the
  viewer's own following list once (`getFollowing`, paginated up to a
  500-person cap) and cross-references it client-side against search
  results — there's no backend search-scoping endpoint, so this is real
  filtering of real data, just done on-device.
- **DM new-chat + emoji picker** — a "New Chat" header button
  (`NewChatScreen.tsx`) searches a user and opens a real conversation via
  the existing `POST /api/v1/users/:username/conversation` endpoint (it
  already supported this — no backend change needed). The emoji picker is
  a fixed, client-only glyph grid that inserts into the composer text;
  file/image attachments were **not** built — `conversations/dto.ts`'s
  `parseSendMessageInput` only accepts text body or a shared Story, and
  adding real attachment upload/storage/moderation is out of proportion to
  an icon-set follow-up.
- **Highlights "Change Cover"** — a Highlight's cover now has a real
  override: `cover_story_id` (migration 0019), settable to any of that
  Highlight's own items via a star toggle in `HighlightEditorScreen.tsx`,
  validated server-side to actually belong to the Highlight, and falling
  back to the original first-item default if that Story is later dropped
  from the set or the override is explicitly cleared.
